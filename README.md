# Overcooked

Made for a school project in Android Studio. 

Instructions:
- Must create an account for first-time users
- Start with 3 lives at level 1
- Permission settings:
    - Allow Overcooked to access photos, media, and files on your device.

Level One
- Click ingredients to gain points within 30 seconds.
- An extra 5 seconds can be bought with one life.
- Each ingredient has different points.
- Earning a special number of points will allow users to finish the level early.

Level Two
- Stack the ingredients.
- Tap the screen to drop the ingredient.
- Once you stack 10 ingredients, you can move to the next level (a "bonus" level two or level 3)
Bonus Level Two
- An instruction page shows the following before the bonus level starts:
    - Stack the ingredients on two different bases
        - Tomato and lettuce should be dropped on the left base
        - Cheese and meat should be dropped on the right base
        - Bread should not be dropped on either base
- This bonus level two is not mandatory; you can choose to skip it and go directly to level three.

Level Three
- Tap the left or the right side of the screen to move the player.
- Receive six cheese to win the game.
- Score will decrease by 10 if you receive a bad ingredient (Green square).

* If you cannot run the application for the first time (e.g. NullPointerException),
  run the program a second time. Android Studio can be buggy.
